# [abazly.com](https://abazly.com)

It's my personal blog, in source code form!

## it's in the clouds

Stored here on Github, hooked into AWS CodePipeline to deploy to an S3 bucket that my domains point at. Fancy! (Not really. But kinda, a little. 🎩)

## what's in it?

Gatsby and stuff. Check out [this post](src/posts/2020-01-25-firstpostforreal.md) for details 🔍

Or for the actual, literal details, check out [package.json](/package.json) 😁

## how do I run it?

Overall, this is a [Gatsby starter project](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/), which covers all the details including what you need to have installed (node and gatsby CLI).

Otherwise, it's just `npm install` -> `npm run start` to get devvin' 💻🖱🍻

## what're you doin next?

My general todos/probably-will-maybe-dos are:

- add in [react helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet) and do some SEO stuff (and most importantly add a page title, a randomized-on-load one)
- add tags to posts and a tag cloud
- add some damn color, blog is too drab
