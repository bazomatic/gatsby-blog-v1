## Wow! 21 months!

Blog's all (hastily) patched up, surprised the pipeline still works. At least I do in fact have proof of the SMALLEST of efforts (it was a lot of effort):

Slowly working on a match-3 game in the spirit of Dungeon Raid, but in space, with different combat. Also a dash of Faster Than Light. Well, more than a dash. Look, it'll be simple. Not gonna lose focus on this to feature creep (just losing focus on it due to repeated unnecessary refactors, heh).

Finally updated the blog, at least! Also, studying up on AWS again, going to re-certify now that I have some projects that will use it a lot more.

Going to be doing more entries, mostly out of necessity to keep myself honest while I chip away at cert studies and projects.

## Things I used here

ðŸŽ° Wilmer Lin's [Make a Match-Three Puzzle Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/make-a-puzzle-match-game-in-unity/) Udemy tutorial. This was extremely useful for me to get into using Unity with some core concepts. I've decided that for my first few games, I do want cross-platform support with write-once porting that I don't have to think about, and I don't want to do anything overly complex. Yet. After I ship ONE game, though, time to bust out Unity ECS and multithreaded simulation using C# jobs âš¡ðŸ’¥ Wilmer also explains some great Unity basics like how to account for different display aspect ratios on your game.

ðŸŽ¥ [Open Broadcast Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to capture gameplay footage, then uploaded to [imgur](https://imgur.com) and embedded as an .mp4 (imgur automatically converts OBS .mkv output to .mp4)

### bonus

the original quick and dirty refactor of the Match3 tutorial before I started to really chop up the code to move towards what I want:
