WILL IT BLEND?!

Setting up the pipeline has been easier than I expected, further reinforcing that I was 100% in the right to procrastinate on doing this as long as I did. I already had the site building and manually deploying, so following Joshua Walsh's guide and using the template from Greeshma Sindhe's tutorial, I think it took like 15 minutes at most.

Now, time to pull the trigger and see if it builds...
