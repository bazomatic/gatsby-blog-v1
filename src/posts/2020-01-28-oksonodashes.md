David Wehle gave a [great talk at GDC 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5f7yixtQPc) about how he one-manned The First Tree while working full-time, in addition to being a parent and spouse. He gave a ton of really great advice about time management and marketing tactics, and his "low-time high-impact" approach to both game dev and game marketing.

The main takeaway I had was his concept of trying to "never have a 0% day," meaning that no matter how burnt out you feel for the day, try to do the smallest thing possible to work towards getting your project finished.

In this case, I ended up jotting down half of this article yesterday, and updated my sidebar today (which I planned to do yesterday but was already wiped out). With the sidebar being done-enough-for-now, the page is in a decent place for a first iteration, so I'm going to focus on some kind of gamedev. I'm constantly indecisive between graphics engines for a game client:

- [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/), JavaScript/WebGL/[PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/)-based
  - Huge pro is anything I write there is playable on any browser
  - Downside is this is the library I'm least familiar with of these three, though I've still gotten some POCs done with it and like it
- [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com), Java/OpenGL-based
  - I'm definitely the most comfortable with this
- [Unity](https://unity.com), a more-or-less .NET engine with tons of integrations
  - realistically this is the easiest way for me to ever achieve any kind of 3d game, and this has the most community support of these three choices

I'll keep working on this site over time, but I want to get a game to the finish line, no matter how small (as long as I can say I'm honestly proud of it) just to say I actually made a damn game. The last time I finished at least an iteration of a game, as in it was actually playable, was over 15 years ago; you'd think I'd have gotten better at that over time üòì

Anyway, expect more rambling and stream-of-consciousness posts like this, especially on my closer-to-0% days üòÅ Next update will likely be about whichever unfinished project I pick up out of my pile and declare as "this, THIS is the one I'm totally going to finish this time." <img src="hmmyes.gif" />
