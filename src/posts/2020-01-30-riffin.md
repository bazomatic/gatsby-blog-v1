Couldn't let it lie, had to 'fix' my pipeline. It was working fine, _except_ that I either had to manually invalidate my Cloudfront cache or wait for it to expire the cache on its own based on whatever default setting I left it at, like 12 or 24 hours or something. I retooled everything to live in the `buildspec.yml` file; CodePipeline now just listens for Github hooks and then kicks off my build, while CodeBuild does the rest.

One suggestion I came across while debating how to solve this was using a Lambda to invalidate the cache, then have CodePipeline execute that Lambda. This appealed to me at first, but I decided it was ultimately too much unnecessary complexity. Doing everything in `buildspec` also means more practice with the AWS CLI for me as well as a single place to know exactly what happens when AWS builds the app. The only real downside I can see is that now my IAM role for CodeBuild has additional permissions that would've otherwise be spread over multiple roles, which is still least-permissions-needed anyway so I'm not terribly worried (though looking at it, I'm surprised how much permission the default CodePipeline role receives).

Tossed in a few layout and style changes while I was at it, and a custom (short) readme for the repo.

Alright, **now** the site is finished-enough-for-now ðŸ˜ƒ
