Hey hey! I'm proud to finally host a page for sharing what I learn, and generally keeping a record of my side projects and hobbies. A handy side effect is now I feel obligated to have some kind of regular cadence for updates, so perhaps I'll actually deliver at least a single independent application this year 😄

## Under the hood

Here's a summary of the tech I chose, along with some lessons learned:

- The page is built with a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) starter project.
  - I chose Gatsby to experiment with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), along with the magically-optimized serverside rendering that it provides.
  - Posts are currently generated from Markdown files via [Gatsby's MDX plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/) as I already prefer Markdown for writing in general; embedding React inside of it is a huge bonus.
- Hosting is handled via an [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with SSL certificates applied via [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
  - Cloudfront is actually necessary because AWS doesn't let you use HTTPS with custom domains for S3 hosted sites. The speed bonus of a CDN is a nice plus.
- Setting up TLS/HTTPS redirects for abazly.com was pretty painless using AWS:
  - Request SSL via [ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)
  - Set up Cloudfront distributions for each site hosting bucket
  - Update domain DNS aliases to point at the Cloudfront endpoints in [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- Cost-wise, I'm paying a few pennies a month, unless this blows the hell up and I get enough traffic to incur terabytes of traffic.

## On the horizon

Immediate things I want to implement:

- Get traffic analytics/SEO tags onto the page
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline, probably using Github actions to just dump the built site into the right S3 bucket on commit to master
- Finish up the sidebar
- Spruce up the styles in general; it's clean, at least
