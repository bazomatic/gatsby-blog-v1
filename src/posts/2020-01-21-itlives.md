They sure are! And now, thanks to (a properly configured) [Gatsby Mdx plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/) I can drop in markdown files to publish new posts, as long as I include some handy frontmatter!

Next up: hosting this out of an [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)!

eventually: making this less ugly! perhaps sooner rather than later...
